5,Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time,"Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time (known as Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time in most PAL countries) is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 video game console. It is the sequel to Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction and Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 in North America on October 27, 2009, in Australia on November 5, 2009, and in Europe on November 6, 2009.
A fourth installment, titled Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus, was released in November 2013 for the PlayStation 3.","Continuing from the end of Quest for Booty, Clank has been abducted by the Zoni to a place called the Great Clock on behalf of the robot Dr. Nefarious, who is trying to discover the secret of the facility from him. Nefarious attempts to access Clank's memory banks for the key to something called the Orvus Chamber but is not allowed to do so because of the Zoni. Nefarious then sets free his Hypersonic Brainwave Scrambler, causing the Zoni to flee and a blackout to occur. When the power is restored, Clank has awoken and attempts to escape, but is caught by Nefarious and his butler, Lawrence and promptly immobilized.
Clank awakens later to find himself with a robot named Sigmund who is the Junior Caretaker of the facility, with no sign of Nefarious and his troops. Through the use of stations called mnemonic chambers that tap into his memory banks, Clank learns that the Great Clock was constructed by the Zoni scientist Orvus as a means to heal damage to the universe caused through excessive misuse of time-travel. A portion of Orvus still resides in Clank's memory banks, put there when Clank was constructed by the Zoni so that one day Clank would be able to take up the mantle of Senior Caretaker, with the help of the Zoni. Clank also learns that his father left for an outpost on Zanifar and never returned to the Clock.
Meanwhile, Ratchet and Qwark explore the Breegus System for information on Clank and Nefarious. They learn of an ""exile"" that is also fighting Nefarious, and trace the being down to another Lombax, General Alister Azimuth. While exploring Krell Canyon for an Obsidian Eye to talk to Clank, Azimuth tells Ratchet he knows of his parents and that it was his fault that Emperor Tachyon was able to come to power, having shared the Lombaxes' technical genius with him. When the Lombaxes left for another dimension, Azimuth was forced to stay behind as punishment for his ""crimes"". Azimuth also tells Ratchet about the Great Clock, and that they may be able to use it to bring back the Lombaxes to this universe. After speaking to Clank through an Obsidian Eye and saving Qwark from a war grok named Snowball, Ratchet uses a time portal on Zanifar to find out what happened to Orvus. Nefarious captured the Zoni to try and get into the Orvus Chamber, but failed after Orvus vanished into thin air. Ratchet managed to make his escape and save Azimuth from Nefarious's henchman, Lord Vorselon. (But not before altering Nefarious's appearance by giving his past self a permanent scar on his right eye)
Ratchet and Azimuth manage to free Clank from another group of Nefarious's henchwomen, the Valkyries. Clank then manages to persuade Ratchet that Azimuth's plan to use the Clock would inevitably destroy the universe, prompting Azimuth to leave sadly. Ratchet, Clank & Qwark then launch a stealth mission aboard Nefarious' base, but are eventually caught. Before launching Ratchet and Clank on an asteroid into deep space, Nefarious reveals that he plans to use the Great Clock to go back in time to foil the various heroes across the universe and create a present where villains always reign supreme. Ratchet and Clank's asteroid crashes into a nearby planet (Planet Morklon) though the two are unharmed due to the Zoni protecting them. They see the world they landed on was destroyed. A surviving fongiod named Yurik reveled this was cause by the Agorians ten years ago and told the story of the battle of Gimlick Valley. One day Agorians suddenly attacked the peaceful village and captured many Fongiod villagers. The tribe leader and an army of soldiers were put together to fight, only for the tribe leader to get killed and the Agorians destroyed the dam wiping out the Fongoid village. They use a similar time portal from Zanifar to rescue the Fongoids of the past ten years ago to the battle of Gimlick valley. They enter combat with Agorians saving child Yurik who tells Ratchet to save the prisoners. After freeing the prisoners with help from the Fongoids, they confront Commander Argos, an Agorian general who was piloting his ship. The duo destroy the ship as it sinks into the dam. Fongoids cheered in victory and then the duo returned to the present where they see a different more peaceful village of Gimlick valley. Where the duos surprise are giant hedges memorial of the duo and is the 10 year anniversary of the day the duo save the Fongiod village. The duo meet with a Fongiod who they ask to borrow the memorial ship that Argos used during the battle that apparently has been recovered and repaired since it fell into the dam. The duo return to Nefarious to face him again before he can reach the Clock. They are able to defeat him aboard his ship, but Lawrence manages to slip away in the escape pod as the ship veers off course towards Nefarious's base. Just as the ship is about to impact, Azimuth arrives to rescue Ratchet and Clank. As the duo run towards Azimuth's ship, Nefarious's ship crashes into it and destroys the base.
The group returns to the Great Clock, where Clank is ready to resume his duties. However, Ratchet & Clank both refuse Azimuth the chance to use the machine to bring back the Lombaxes. Azimuth suddenly snaps, furious that Ratchet no longer wants what he does. His ambition turns to corruption and he fires his weapon at Ratchet, knocking him over the edge of the platform and killing him. While Clank manages to give chase to the General, Sigmund tries to stop him, but Azimuth overpowers him, and then Clank locks himself in the Orvus Chamber to prevent Azimuth from getting in. Remembering the words of The Plumber that he wouldn't risk any more than 6 minutes, Clank initiates a time shift to go back in time six minutes, where he is able to push Ratchet out of way of Azimuth's blast and alter the events. Ratchet and Azimuth then race though a grind rail to get into the Orvus Chamber. The duo are too late and Azimuth activates the Clock to shift backwards to try to bring the Lombaxes home. Ratchet then fights Azimuth with the fate of the entire universe in the balance. As he and Ratchet fight, the Clock starts to fall apart around them, unable to take the strain of such a massive shift. As Ratchet shouts at him to stop what he's done, Azimuth realizes his mistake. He tells Ratchet to ""take care of himself"" and gives his own life to stop the Clock from self destructing by using his wrench to replace the broken lever and turning it. However, by doing it, he gets hit by a lethal energy blast from the broken Clock and dies.
After the Zoni repair the chamber, Ratchet bids Clank a farewell, wishing him well as he walks away. Clank, hearing the recorded words of Orvus again, realizes he cannot stay because he cannot leave Ratchet until he finds his family since Ratchet's actions helped find Clank's home. Clank promotes Sigmund to Senior Caretaker and, as Orvus says in the background that his son can do whatever makes him feel whole as he rejoins Ratchet just as he's about to leave. Together, they soar into the stars for another adventure.","['Shooter', 'Platform', 'Adventure', 'Arcade']","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Science fiction', 'Comedy', 'Kids', 'Open world']","['time travel', 'robots', 'time manipulation', 'spaceship', 'action-adventure', 'space battle', 'multiple protagonists', 'backtracking', 'building', 'artificial intelligence', 'dancing', 'teleportation', 'wall jump', 'playstation network', '8-bit', 'boss fight', 'explosion', 'anthropomorphism', 'platform exclusive', 'playstation trophies', '60 fps on consoles', 'voice acting', ""protagonist's name in the title"", 'bink video', 'polygonal 3d', 'skill points in game', 'upgradeable weapons', 'game reference', 'cameo appearance', 'collectibles', 'unlockables', 'save point', 'save file unlockables', 'black market', 'auto-aim', 'auto-saving', 'a.i. companion', 'difficulty level', 'internet culture reference', 'floating island', 'arcade cabinet', 'moving platforms', 'destructible environment', 'in-game radio', 'planet jumping', 'villain', 'unlockable difficulty level', 'pre-order exclusive', 'unskippable cutscene', 'mirror mode', 'kidnapping', 'new game plus', 'time paradox', 'cutscene menu', 'reversible cover art', 'combat-based platformer', 'playstation home tie-in', 'fictional currencies', 'potential love interest', 'greatest hits', 'metagame', 'sixaxis support', 'box art - half of face displayed', 'tokyo game show 2009', 'pax 2009', 'gamescom 2009', 'male protagonist']","Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time (known as Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time in most PAL countries) is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 video game console.

The fate of Faerun lies in your hands. Alone, you may resist. But together, you can overcome. The land of Faerûn is in turmoil. Refugees cross the wilds, fleeing the helltorn stronghold of Elturel. A vicious cult marches across the Sword Coast, uniting every race of monsters and men under the banner of a cryptic god they call the Absolute. Chaos strikes at Faerûn's foundations, and none may escape its talons. Not even you.

The grotesque nautiloid ship appears out of nowhere, blotting out the sun. Its writhing tentacles snatch you from where you stand. The mind flayers have come, imprisoning you on their ship, infecting you with their horrid parasite. You will become one of them.

33,Infamous: Second Son,"Infamous: Second Son, a PlayStation 4 exclusive , brings you an action adventure game where surrounded by a society that fears them, superhumans are ruthlessly hunted down and caged by the Department of Unified Protection. Step into a locked-down Seattle as Delsin Rowe, who has recently discovered his superhuman power and is now capable of fighting back against the oppressive DUP. Enjoy your power as you choose how you will push your awesome abilities to the limit and witness the consequences of your actions as they affect the city and people around you.","Second Son takes place in 2016, seven years after Infamous 2's Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure humanity of a plague and destroy The Beast. Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him and most of the other Conduits. The U.S. government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative ""Bioterrorists "". The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Mimicry, allowing him to copy the powers of any Conduit he comes into contact with. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit with power over Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry ""Hank"" Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail ""Fetch"" Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex-junkie who uses her Neon powers to hunt down illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video game addict who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.

after Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their subsequent argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages to pull the third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, inadvertently absorbing his smoke powers in the process. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank in an effort to figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or say nothing. Regardless of Delsin's choice, Augustine knocks him out before moving on to the other tribe members.

Delsin awakens a week later and discovers that Augustine has tortured the rest of the tribe in an unsuccessful bid to gain information. However, she has left them to gradually die from concrete shards buried into their bodies, including their leader Betty (Karen Austin). Reggie, who was spared from the torture, learns that the only way to remove the shards is to use Augustine's power on them. Delsin realizes that he can absorb Conduit powers and resolves to go to Seattle to take Augustine's powers and save the tribe. Reggie reluctantly accompanies Delsin to keep an eye on him. They reach Seattle and find that it has been put under strict martial law by the D.U.P. in order to find the other escaped Conduits. With Reggie's help, Delsin battles D.U.P. forces and tracks down core fragments to develop his powers. He eventually encounters the other two escaped Conduits, Fetch and Eugene, and absorbs their powers. After both confrontations, Delsin defends the Conduits from Reggie, who initially views them as ""freaks"", and can choose to either redeem or corrupt them.","['Shooter', 'Platform', 'Adventure']","['Action', 'Sandbox', 'Open world']","['helicopter', 'military', 'action-adventure', 'building', 'over the shoulder', 'sequel', 'good vs evil', 'superhero', 'playstation network', 'comic book', 'single-player only', 'platform exclusive', 'playstation trophies', 'playing cards', 'voice acting', 'corrupt government', 'human', 'photo mode', 'native american', 'original soundtrack release', 'profanity', 'descendants of other characters', 'sprinting mechanics', 'playstation plus', 'saving the world', 'moral decisions', 'side quests', 'real-time combat', 'female antagonist', 'audio logs', 'pax prime 2013', 'gamescom 2013', 'rpg elements', 'mercenary', 'destructible environment', 'terrorists', 'anti-hero', 'starfish', 'trophies', 'car accident', 'motion capture animation', 'dynamic soundtrack', 'banter during gameplay', 'gliding', 'new protagonist in sequel', 'zero to hero', 'superpowers', 'fascism', 'anti-villain', 'sealing your own fate', 'male protagonist', 'seattle', 'previously on - playstation plus extra', 'previously on - playstation plus classic', 'previously on - playstation now']","Infamous: Second Son Infamous: Second Son, a PlayStation 4 exclusive , brings you an action adventure game where surrounded by a society that fears them, superhumans are ruthlessly hunted down and caged by the Department of Unified Protection.
